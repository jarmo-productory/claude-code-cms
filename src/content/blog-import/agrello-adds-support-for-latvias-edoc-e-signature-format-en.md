## Why EDOC Matters for Latvian Users

The EDOC (Electronically Certified Document) format is Latvia’s trusted standard for secure e-signatures, and its foundation is based on the European ASiC (Associated Signature Containers) structure. In essence, EDOC is a specialized implementation of [ASiC](https://www.agrello.io/post/pdf-and-asic-document-output-types), developed to meet Latvia’s legal and regulatory standards for document authentication and long-term validation. By integrating EDOC into Agrello’s offerings, we empower our users to interact confidently with Latvian institutions, ensuring their documents meet the strict compliance requirements for official submissions and transactions.

Here’s how it works: the EDOC format leverages ASiC-E, a container model for storing both the data and the digital signature in a single, secure package. Within this structure, EDOC files use XAdES (XML Advanced Electronic Signatures), an advanced XML-based signature standard that provides enhanced security features, such as long-term validation with qualified timestamps and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). This system ensures that every EDOC document retains its validity over time, maintaining signature integrity and regulatory compliance.

By adopting EDOC, Agrello users gain access to a robust solution that aligns seamlessly with Latvian e-signature requirements, allowing them to sign, submit, and manage documents for government, business, and personal use with complete peace of mind.

## How EDOC Integration Enhances Agrello's Offerings

With the inclusion of EDOC, Agrello now offers support for [PDF](https://www.agrello.io/post/secure-your-pdf-documents-with-pades-signatures), [ASIC](https://www.agrello.io/digital-signing/what-is-asic-container-and-xades-signature), and EDOC formats, giving users a wide array of choices to fulfill their document signing requirements. This multi-format capability not only ensures greater flexibility but also reinforces Agrello’s commitment to compliance with European [eIDAS](https://www.agrello.io/post/what-level-signatures-can-you-give-on-agrello-platform) (Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services) standards.

The EDOC format is particularly suited for official documentation, given its robust structure and added features for long-term validation. By aligning with EDOC’s rigorous standards, Agrello offers users the ability to securely store and transmit documents with advanced protections that go beyond typical e-signature requirements. This includes qualified timestamps and structured certificate validations, which are essential for maintaining document authenticity over extended periods.

In short, our EDOC support brings heightened assurance to users across various sectors, from government entities needing to process official paperwork to businesses and individuals seeking secure, compliant digital signing options. With Agrello’s expanded format options, users can confidently manage all document types, knowing they are backed by the latest in secure signing technology.

## Practical Use Cases for EDOC

Agrello’s support for the EDOC format opens up a range of practical applications, making it easier for users to manage document workflows across multiple sectors:

- **Government Services**: For those needing to submit official documents to Latvian state or municipal entities, EDOC support ensures seamless compatibility with government requirements. Whether it’s filing applications, submitting regulatory documents, or communicating with public institutions, users can rely on EDOC to meet the necessary standards for secure digital submission.
- **Business Transactions**: In the corporate world, security and compliance are essential, especially when dealing with contracts, agreements, or sensitive documentation. EDOC’s added layers of validation and timestamping mean that businesses can confidently process contracts, secure their contents, and maintain compliance with EU regulations. This format is particularly valuable for companies looking to establish legally binding agreements without the need for in-person signatures.
- **Personal Use**: For individuals needing to sign personal applications, forms, or other official paperwork, EDOC provides a straightforward and legally compliant way to sign documents electronically. With Agrello’s platform, users can easily select the EDOC format and complete their signing tasks with just a few clicks, bringing greater convenience to everyday processes.

By catering to these specific use cases, Agrello’s EDOC support meets the needs of a broad user base, making secure and compliant digital signing accessible to all.
