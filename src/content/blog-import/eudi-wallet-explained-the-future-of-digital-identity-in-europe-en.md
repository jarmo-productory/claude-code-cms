The European Commission’s _EU Digital Identity Wallet_ initiative aims to change that. The wallet is a **government‑approved mobile app** that lets people and businesses authenticate themselves online or in person and store official digital documents in one place. The EU Commission describes the wallets as a _safe, reliable and private means of digital identification_ that will be available to all EU citizens, residents and businesses.

Every Member State must provide at least one wallet built to common EU specifications by 2026. The goal is to give users control over their personal data – _“your personal data tells your life’s story; you should be the one to control it”_ – while making it simple to share only the information required for a transaction. This article explains what the EUDI wallet is, why it matters for businesses and how it will roll out, and also provides real‑world examples and answers to common questions.

## **What is the EUDI Wallet?**

The European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet is a **government‑backed mobile application** that will allow EU residents and businesses to prove who they are online or in person without carrying paper documents. The European Commission describes it as **Europe’s answer to the challenges of identification**: it will let people access public and private services, store and share digital documents and create legally binding electronic signatures.

The wallet will hold **pre‑verified personal details**, such as national ID cards, driving licences, diplomas and even company certificates, and organisations can also get business wallets. Users can log in to services securely, share only the attributes that are needed (for example, proving they are over 18 without revealing a full date of birth) and sign documents at the highest level of assurance.

From a regulatory perspective, the EUDI Wallet is part of **eIDAS 2.0**, the revised EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services. The 2024 European Digital Identity Framework requires each member state to offer at least one national wallet app and to recognise wallets issued by other member states. The regulation mandates strong security standards and “privacy by design” – meaning users decide which data to share and can keep track of it. The wallet functions as a decentralised digital identity ecosystem: public or private organisations issue verified credentials into the wallet, and service providers (relying parties) accept those credentials. Users always remain in control.

### **Key features at a glance**

Feature

Description

Secure authentication

Users can log in to services using strong customer authentication. Businesses and regulated industries must accept the wallet for authentication by 2027.

Selective disclosure

The wallet allows sharing only necessary attributes (for example, proving age or nationality) instead of the full identity. This reduces data exposure and helps comply with privacy laws.

Document storage and sharing

It can store digital versions of identity documents, diplomas, licences, prescriptions and business certificates. Users can share credentials directly with banks, employers or government agencies.

Qualified electronic signatures

The wallet supports qualified e‑signatures and seals, allowing users to sign contracts or authorise payments with legal validity.

Interoperability

Wallets follow a common Architecture and Reference Framework so they work across borders and with both public and private services. Service providers must recognise any certified wallet issued in the EU.

Free to use

Member states must provide the wallet free of charge to citizens and businesses. Users will be able to download their national app and use it anywhere in the EU.

## **Why it matters for businesses**

### **Easier onboarding and compliance**

The wallet provides **trusted, pre‑verified customer data** directly from official sources. Businesses can rely on credentials issued by governments, banks or universities, which reduces paperwork and Know‑Your‑Customer (KYC) costs. Regulated industries (banking, insurance, telecom, healthcare and energy) will be required by law to accept the wallet as a means of authentication by 2027. This means companies will need to integrate wallet‑based login and identity checks into their processes.

### **Reduced fraud and stronger security**

The wallet uses strong cryptographic signatures and tamper‑proof credentials. Service providers trust the credentials because they are digitally signed by the issuing authority. Because users share only the data required, businesses receive fewer unnecessary details, which helps protect against identity theft and fraud. The EU framework also mandates compliance with cybersecurity requirements.

### **Cross-border opportunities**

With interoperable wallets, a Danish customer can open a bank account in France or rent a car in Spain using the same digital identity. For businesses, this means a larger addressable market and simplified verification when dealing with customers or partners from other EU countries. The wallet fosters a harmonised digital single market, reducing reliance on big platform identity services.

### **Privacy and trust**

Modern consumers and business partners expect transparency in how their personal data is handled. The wallet’s consent‑driven design and privacy dashboard allow users to see what they have shared and revoke access when needed. Demonstrating respect for privacy can strengthen customer relationships and help meet strict EU data‑protection rules such as the GDPR.

### **New business models**

Companies will be able to **issue their own digital credentials**. For example, a manufacturer could send warranties or service certificates directly to a customer’s wallet, and a training provider could issue digital diplomas. This opens opportunities for innovative services and revenue streams.

## **How and when the wallet will be rolled out**

### **EU regulatory timeline**

The EU Digital Identity Regulation (Regulation EU 2024/1183) entered into force in May 2024. Member states must provide a national EUDI Wallet to citizens and businesses within **24 months** of the adoption of the implementing acts. The implementing acts were adopted on **28 November 2024**, so each member state must have at least one wallet available by **late 2026**. The regulation also obliges service providers in sectors requiring strong customer authentication (e.g., banking, healthcare, telecommunications) to accept the wallet by **2027**.

### **Pilot projects and phased deployment**

Development of the EUDI Wallet began in 2020 and is being tested through **large‑scale pilot projects** across the EU. The European Commission notes that over **350 companies and public authorities** in **26 member states plus Norway, Iceland and Ukraine** are participating. The first group of pilots started on **1 April 2023**, and a second phase is planned for **2025**. These pilots test use cases such as opening bank accounts, accessing government services, mobile driving licences and digital travel credentials. Insights from the pilots will inform national implementations. Several countries have already launched or expanded digital ID apps that will evolve into EUDI‑compliant wallets.

### **National variations**

Member states can develop wallets themselves or contract private providers, but the apps must meet the EU’s certification requirements. Some countries, such as Austria, Belgium, France and Italy, are building on existing digital ID apps and gradually adding EUDI wallet functions. Others, like Spain and Germany, are still in the development phase. While each national wallet will look different, they will follow the **same technical standards** so that businesses can integrate once and serve users from any EU country.

### **Examples of existing national digital ID wallets**

Several EU countries already offer digital ID apps that provide a glimpse of what the EUDI wallet experience will look like. These examples show that while each app is tailored to national laws and services, they share common features such as digital credentials, selective disclosure and integration with government systems.

Germany

National EUDI Wallet initiative

Under development; public prototype competition

Germany plans to introduce a state digital identity wallet as part of the EU scheme; the first function will be identification with the ability to produce digital documents and sign with a qualified electronic signature; the wallet will gradually expand its functions and should be usable by 2027. Authorities are also enabling non‑state providers to offer wallets and running a prototype competition through the SPRIND innovation agency.

Finland

National digital identity wallet

Project in progress

Finland’s Ministry of Finance launched a project on 26 April 2024 to develop a national wallet by 31 December 2026. The Digital and Population Data Services Agency will implement it following the eIDAS 2.0 rules; the government promises that users will control how their data is used and that services accepting the wallet will be registered and supervised.

These examples show that member states are moving at different speeds. Austria, France, Italy, Belgium and Poland already allow citizens to store digital credentials in apps, while Spain is piloting an age‑assurance wallet and Germany and Finland are still developing their solutions. Regardless of the approach, the EU’s regulation requires that by 2026 every country provides at least one wallet compliant with the EUDI specification.

## **What businesses should do now**

1.  **Stay informed.** Follow national announcements about wallet roll‑outs and participate in industry consultations. Because the implementing acts were adopted in November 2024, legal requirements will be finalised soon. Understanding your country’s timeline will help you plan compliance.
2.  **Prepare systems.** Review your digital customer journeys (onboarding, authentication, document signing) and identify where wallet‑based identification would fit. Work with your IT/security teams or vendors to integrate the wallet’s authentication protocols and to accept verified credentials. Consider joining pilot projects or partnering with wallet providers early to gain experience.
3.  **Educate staff and customers.** Train customer‑facing teams about how the wallet works and its benefits. Inform customers that they will soon be able to log in and share data using their national wallet, which reduces the need to upload documents or fill out lengthy forms.
4.  **Embrace new opportunities.** Think beyond compliance. Explore how issuing digital credentials, such as membership cards, certificates or service confirmations, can streamline your operations and differentiate your services. Consider cross‑border expansion or partnerships that become easier when identity and trust are harmonised across the EU.

## **Summary**

The EUDI Wallet is a cornerstone of the EU’s digital transformation. It is **not just a government ID app** but a **user‑controlled digital wallet** for individuals and businesses to prove identity, store documents and sign electronically across the EU. It builds on the revised **eIDAS 2.0** regulation and aims to reduce fraud, protect privacy and improve cross‑border services. Member states must roll out wallet apps by late 2026, and regulated industries will need to accept them by 2027. Businesses should start preparing now so they can harness the efficiencies and new opportunities that this trusted digital identity ecosystem will bring.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### **When will the EUDI Wallet be available?**

The European Digital Identity Regulation entered into force in May 2024, and the EU adopted the implementing acts on 28 November 2024. Each member state must provide at least one wallet within 24 months, so national apps are expected by **late 2026**. Some countries already have digital ID apps (see examples above) and will adapt them to meet the EUDI standards.

### **Do I have to use the wallet?**

Participation is voluntary. You can continue using physical documents or existing digital identity methods. National apps like Italy’s IT‑Wallet, Austria’s eAusweise and Belgium’s [MyGov.be](http://mygov.be/) are optional. However, businesses in regulated sectors (banking, telecoms, healthcare, energy) will be required to accept wallet‑based authentication by **2027**.

### **Does every EU country create its own wallet?**

Each Member State must make at least one wallet available to citizens and businesses, but they may develop it themselves or collaborate with private providers. Germany, for example, is running a prototype competition for its national wallet, while Italy has integrated its wallet into the existing IO app. Regardless of the approach, all wallets must follow the EU’s common technical standards.

### **Are digital identity wallets already available?**

Yes. Austria’s **eAusweise** app lets users present digital credentials via short‑lived QR codes; France’s **France Identité** provides single‑use proofs of identity and access to over 1,400 services; Italy’s **IT‑Wallet** stores digital driving licences, health cards and disability cards; Belgium’s [**MyGov.be**](http://mygov.be/) holds official documents and public service access; Poland’s **mObywatel** app hosts digital ID cards, driving licences and other services; and Spain is piloting the **Cartera Digital Beta** for age‑verification and digital credentials. These apps will evolve into EUDI‑compliant wallets by 2026.

### **How will the wallet work across borders?**

The EU has defined a common **Architecture and Reference Framework**. Wallets that meet these standards must be recognised by public and private services across the EU. Large‑scale pilots are testing cross‑border use cases such as opening bank accounts, registering SIM cards and presenting a mobile driving licence. Businesses will be able to integrate once and serve customers from any EU country.

### **How is my data protected?**

The wallets use strong authentication and selective disclosure. Users share only the data required for a particular transaction, and digital credentials are signed by trusted authorities. The Commission emphasises that the system is built around privacy: users control what data they share and can withdraw consent. Implementing acts published in 2025 introduce technical requirements for trusted lists, the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies and risk‑management procedures for trust services.
