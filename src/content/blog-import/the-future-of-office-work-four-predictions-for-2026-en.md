excerpt: 'The end of a year invites reflection, and perhaps a little prophecy. For office work, this is particularly fraught territory. The past few years have delivered more upheaval than the preceding decade: remote work, hybrid arrangements, artificial intelligence, the four-day week. Some of these have become mundane. Others remain experimental. Where does it all lead?'

What follows is not a forecast of certainties. It is an examination of four forces that, based on current evidence, appear likely to shape the office by 2026. Some will surprise; others will confirm what many already suspect. Together, they sketch a workplace that is at once familiar and strange.

## 1\. Technology: AI Assistants and Automation Come to the Office

Artificial intelligence has arrived in the office, though not quite as the futurists promised. It has come not as a job-stealing robot, but as a quiet assistant handling tasks that nobody particularly wanted anyway—sorting emails, answering simple queries, populating spreadsheets.

The numbers tell an interesting story. A [McKinsey survey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work) found that 92% of companies plan to increase their AI investments. Ninety-two per cent. Yet when asked how many have truly integrated AI into daily operations—not as a pilot project tucked away in some corner, but as part of the everyday rhythm—the answer was 1%.

That gap speaks louder than any corporate declaration. The will exists; the know-how does not. Or rather: everyone senses that something is changing, but nobody yet sees clearly what it means for their own office. It is like standing in a landscape where the morning fog has not yet lifted. Outlines are visible, but details remain obscure.

Human resources shows the same pattern. According to [Mercer](https://www.mercer.com/en-us/insights/people-strategy/hr-transformation/heads-up-hr-2025-is-the-year-of-agentic-ai/), 84% of HR leaders believe their field will be substantially automated—chatbots answering employees' repetitive questions, algorithms scanning CVs, platforms assembling training programmes. But belief is a long way from reality. For now, "using AI" typically means someone, somewhere, is experimenting. Not that the whole organisation has begun to function differently.

What does AI actually do? Mostly the dull stuff. It does not replace the office worker; it takes on the portion of work that people did reluctantly anyway. Email triage. First-line customer support. Copying data from one system to another. These are tasks that nobody thinks about when getting up in the morning, yet they consume hours of the day.

[Mercer](https://employerbranding.news/mercers-2025-global-talent-trends-what-it-means-for-employer-branding/) suggests that more than half of executives expect productivity gains of 10–30%. If that happens—and it is a substantial "if"—it will not be because machines started thinking for people, but because people finally got to do what they were actually hired for.

Something called "agentic AI" is on the horizon. The jargon sounds complicated, but the idea is simple: systems that no longer wait for commands but act on their own initiative. Not entirely independently—humans remain the decision-makers—but autonomously enough to free workers from constant supervision. Like an assistant who no longer needs every step spelled out.

The key to this transformation lies not in the technology but in the people. [Research shows](https://www.workday.com/en-us/perspectives/ai/2025/08/25-ways-ai-will-change-the-future-of-work.html) that employees are ready. They believe AI will help them accomplish more and create new value. The question is whether leaders can act quickly and wisely enough to turn that readiness into reality. For now, most remain at the starting line—investments are growing, but maturity is not.

## 2\. Work Arrangements: Hybrid Models, Asynchronous Communication, and the Four-Day Week

The pandemic years made one thing clear: work need not happen in an office. But what comes after the emergency passes? Does everyone return to the old rhythm?

They do not. A [Morgan McKinley survey](https://www.morganmckinley.com/article/remote-work-four-day-weeks-new-era-work-life-balance) shows that 63% of job seekers consider flexibility—the ability to work from home part of the time—a decisive factor. Not a bonus to be appreciated. Decisive. Without it, they go elsewhere.

Here lies a contradiction. [Mercer's data](https://employerbranding.news/mercers-2025-global-talent-trends-what-it-means-for-employer-branding/) indicates that 76% of employees consider flexibility very important in their career choices. Yet only a third of HR leaders place it at the top of their priorities. It is as though two parties are speaking different languages—one insists it is essential, the other treats it as a convenience.

Why does this gap persist? A [Cisco study](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/dam/r/newsroom/pdfs/Cisco-Hybrid-Work-Study.pdf) offers one answer: lack of trust. Some 77% of employees believe that return-to-office mandates are really about control, not collaboration. That managers simply do not trust people to work properly at home. And 81% of employers admit—indirectly, but still—that this is so.

It is a peculiar situation. The work gets done, but trust is absent. And without trust, flexible arrangements can never truly function.

Meanwhile, the world moves on. More teams work across time zones, where not everyone can be "in the office" simultaneously. Meetings give way to written exchanges; real-time communication yields to asynchronous. What matters is not whether someone sits at a desk, but whether the work gets done.

And then there is the four-day week.

The idea sounds simple: same pay, fewer days, productivity maintained. According to the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/10/four-day-week-work-jobs-and-skills/), 92% of companies in pilot programmes continued with a four-day schedule after the trial ended. Employee stress fell, sick days decreased, turnover held steady or improved. Microsoft Japan reported a 40% productivity increase. Buffer saw 22% gains and a third fewer sick days.

Perhaps the most instructive case is Bolt, the San Francisco fintech company. In 2021, founder Ryan Breslow introduced a four-day week with much fanfare. Internal surveys glowed: 94% of employees wanted to keep it, 84% reported higher productivity. In January 2022, Breslow [declared](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/the-4-day-workweek-becomes-permanent-for-tech-company-bolt.html) the policy permanent, telling CNBC he "couldn't imagine running a company any other way."

Three years later, he could imagine it after all. When Breslow returned as CEO in early 2025 after a controversial departure, one of his first acts was to [end the four-day week](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/bolt-4-day-workweek)—along with unlimited paid time off, which he called "totally broken." The luxuries staff had enjoyed, he wrote in an internal message, would be "on hold" until revenue increased substantially.

It is an honest story, if a deflating one. A shorter week is no magic wand that works in all circumstances. When the wind shifts, even the most progressive company may retreat. The policy that once seemed like the future can become, in harder times, a luxury.

A successful transition requires restructuring: fewer meetings, clearer priorities. And perhaps technological help—AI that handles some routine tasks may free exactly the hours that a shorter week demands.

Working hours and locations are no longer set in stone. But for new arrangements to truly function, managers and employees must find a common language. They are still searching.

## 3\. Talent Management: New Approaches to Hiring and Retention

The diploma is no longer what it once was. More companies look at candidates and ask: what can you do? Not: where did you study? This shift—skills over credentials—is quiet but profound. Hiring decisions no longer rest on whether a candidate has the right education, but on whether they have the right abilities.

This brings a new challenge. If skills matter, they must also develop. Employees expect employers to help them learn. [Mercer's data](https://employerbranding.news/mercers-2025-global-talent-trends-what-it-means-for-employer-branding/) shows that 60% of workers trust their employer to invest in their development. But only 18% feel they actually benefit from it.

That gap is telling. Development programmes exist, but they do not work. Or more precisely: they work for ticking boxes, not for growing people. Form without substance. [Workday](https://www.workday.com/en-us/perspectives/ai/2025/08/25-ways-ai-will-change-the-future-of-work.html) suggests the solution may lie in technology—AI-based learning platforms that create personalised development plans for each employee. Not one programme for everyone, but a unique path for each person. Like having a pocket career coach who knows exactly what you should learn next.

But development is not the only thing people seek. They also want room to move.

[81% of companies](https://employerbranding.news/mercers-2025-global-talent-trends-what-it-means-for-employer-branding/) now say they prefer internal mobility to external hiring. Before seeking someone from outside, they look for someone within who might fill the role. Not only because it is cheaper—though it is—but because it retains people. An employee who sees an opportunity to grow will not start looking elsewhere.

Here the employer brand comes into play. Not logos and slogans, but what the company actually offers. The new generation of talent does not simply seek a salary. They seek a place that fits their life—flexible hours, development opportunities, mental health support, a culture where it is good to be.

And if they do not find it? They leave.

One aspect is particularly sharp: leadership. People do not leave companies; they leave managers. It is an old truth, but research confirms it again and again. Yet only [36% of firms](https://employerbranding.news/mercers-2025-global-talent-trends-what-it-means-for-employer-branding/) offer their managers systematic development. As though leadership were an innate gift, not a skill that can be learned.

Here lies an opportunity. Companies that invest in their managers win twice—they retain existing talent and attract new. Every manager is an ambassador of the employer brand, whether they know it or not.

## 4\. The Office Environment: Green, Communal, and Experience-Driven

If people can work from home, why should the office exist at all?

This question has prompted many companies to look at their spaces with fresh eyes. And the answer that emerges is surprisingly simple: the office must offer something that home cannot. Not merely a desk and chair, but an experience.

Part of that experience is the physical environment itself. Plants, natural light, green walls—this is no longer a designer's whim but a scientifically grounded choice. A [Harvard School of Public Health study](https://habitaction.com/resources/sustainable-office-trends-2025) found that people working in green-certified buildings have cognitive function 26% better and 30% fewer sick days. Space affects thinking. An office that breathes helps the people working there to breathe better too.

But environment alone is not enough. What matters more is what happens in the office.

A [Cisco study](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/dam/r/newsroom/pdfs/Cisco-Hybrid-Work-Study.pdf) asked employees what they valued most about office culture. Some 92% answered: collaboration and a sense of community. This ranked higher than any other aspect. People do not come to the office to sit at a computer—that can be done at home. They come for other people. To exchange ideas. For spontaneous conversations by the coffee machine. To feel part of something larger.

This fundamentally changes the office's role. Rows of cubicles give way to collaboration spaces. Meeting rooms acquire quality cameras so remote workers feel equally included. Quiet corners emerge for those who need concentration, and open areas for those seeking company.

[DLR Group](https://www.dlrgroup.com/idea/office-design-trends-2025/) calls this the experience-driven office—a place that reflects organisational values and supports employee wellbeing. Some companies have gone further: meditation rooms, gyms, art installations that tell the company's story. The office as a service, not merely as a space.

A question some firms have begun asking: do people leave the office more energised than when they arrived? If yes, the space is fulfilling its role. If not, something is wrong—and that something is probably not the number of desks or the speed of the wifi.

The future of office work is not a single fixed picture. It is a search for balance—between technology and humanity, flexibility and community, efficiency and wellbeing.

By 2026, we will see offices where artificial intelligence handles routine, work arrangements adapt to people's lives, talent management invests in development, and the office itself becomes a place people choose to be. Not from obligation, but from preference.

This is an opportunity. But also a responsibility—for those who shape the working environment.

_One thing is certain: the 2026 office will not look like the 2019 office. And that is not bad news._
