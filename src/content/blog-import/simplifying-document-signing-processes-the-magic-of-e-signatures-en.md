## The Evolution of E-Signatures

E-signatures have been around since the 1980s, but they really took off in the early 2000s. Thanks to advancements in technology like public key infrastructure (PKI), encryption algorithms, and digital certificates, e-signatures are now as secure as they are convenient. Plus, with legal recognitions like the ESIGN Act in the U.S. and the eIDAS Regulation in the EU, e-signatures are legally recognized and enforceable. So, you can rest easy knowing your digital John Hancock is just as valid as the inked version.
