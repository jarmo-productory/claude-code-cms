But what sets Smart-ID apart from other electronic identification and signing methods, and how has its adoption influenced digital transformation and e-governance?

## How Does Smart-ID Ensure Security and Privacy?

Smart-ID prioritizes your security and privacy through a robust, multi-layered approach that is both user-friendly and legally compliant.

As a Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD) certified under the [European eIDAS regulation](https://www.agrello.io/post/what-should-you-know-about-eidas-when-e-signing-eu-business-contracts), **Smart-ID guarantees that your digital signatures carry the same legal validity as handwritten ones**, offering confidence and peace of mind in every transaction.

**Your personal identification numbers (PINs)** act as the gateway to accessing and signing with Smart-ID. To enhance security, these PINs are never stored on your device or Smart-ID servers. Even if your device is compromised, your account remains safe.

Smart-ID employs **advanced cryptographic technologies** to protect your private keys. These keys are securely stored and remain inaccessible to you or any external system, ensuring maximum data protection.

To prevent unauthorized access, **Smart-ID includes a feature that locks your account** after several incorrect PIN attempts. This safeguard, combined with reminders to keep PINs confidential, enhances overall security.

The **platform is regularly audited** and complies with strict data protection laws, meeting the highest security standards and proactively adapting to regulatory changes.

To help users stay vigilant, Smart-ID provides clear educational resources and a dedicated support team, ensuring you have the tools and knowledge to secure your account effectively. Practical tips, like keeping your device and applications up to date and monitoring account activity, are also emphasized to further strengthen your security.

## How to sign a document using Smart-ID?

Signing documents with Smart-ID is a straightforward process that enables you to provide legally binding digital signatures equivalent to handwritten ones. Here's how you can sign documents using Smart-ID:

‍

**1\. Get Smart-ID app**

You can download Smart-ID app [from here](https://www.smart-id.com/download/).

‍

**2\. Verify Your Smart-ID Account Level (optional)**

Ensure that your Smart-ID account is set to the "Qualified Electronic Signature" (QES) level, as only this level provides signatures with the same legal standing as handwritten signatures. To check your account level:

- Open the Smart-ID app on your device.
- Navigate to the "User info" section in the app menu.
- Confirm that it states "Smart-ID Qualified Electronic Signature."
- If it displays a different account level, you will need to upgrade your account. This involves updating the app, deleting your existing account, and registering a new one. 

‍

**3\. Choose a Signing Platform**

Smart-ID is only a secure signature creation device. You need a 3rd party app to upload a document and then use Smart-ID for creating a secure signature. 

There are several methods to sign documents using Smart-ID:

- **Online Signing Services:** Platforms like [Agrello](https://www.agrello.io/) and MARK Sign allow you to upload and sign documents directly through their websites. 
- **Mobile Applications:** For iPhone users, the Dokobit app is available for download, enabling document signing on the go. You can also use **Agrello** web app over mobile.
- **Desktop Software:** The [DigiDoc4](https://www.id.ee/artikkel/paigalda-id-tarkvara/) Client software allows you to sign documents on your computer. After installing the software, you can open the document you wish to sign and select the option to sign with Smart-ID. 

‍

**4\. Signing the Document**

The general steps for signing a document using Smart-ID are as follows:

- **Initiate the Signing Process:** Open the document in your chosen platform (e.g. [**Agrello**](https://docs.agrello.io), DigiDoc4) and select the option to sign with Smart-ID.
- **Verify Control Code:** A control code will be displayed both on the signing platform and in your Smart-ID app. Ensure that these codes match to confirm the authenticity of the transaction.
- **Enter PIN2:** In the Smart-ID app, enter your PIN2 to authorize the signature.
- **Complete the Process:** Once the PIN2 is accepted, the document will be signed digitally. You can then download or share the signed document as needed.

‍

**Important Considerations**

Document Formats: Electronically signed documents may come in different formats. The ASiC-E format (with a .asice extension) is the more common in the Baltics is recommended for compatibility. 

Account Validity: Smart-ID accounts are valid for three years. Ensure you renew your account before it expires to maintain uninterrupted service. 

By following these steps, you can efficiently sign documents digitally using Smart-ID, ensuring both security and legal compliance.

## How Does Smart-ID Compare to Other Electronic Identification Methods?

### Estonian ID Card

The Estonian ID card serves as a mandatory identity document and a tool for electronic identification and digital signatures. It contains a chip with cryptographic keys used for online authentication and document signing. While it supports extensive e-services, electronic voting, and even serves as a travel document within the EU, it requires a card reader and specific software, which might limit its usability compared to mobile solutions.

### Mobile-ID

Mobile-ID enables users to authenticate and sign documents using mobile phones through a SIM card-based system, requiring a special SIM card. It matches the ID card in terms of security and is convenient for mobile access, though users incur a small monthly fee from mobile operators.

### Smart-ID

Smart-ID is an app-based solution that operates without the need for a SIM card or card reader, making it highly accessible on smartphones, tablets, and some smartwatches. As a QSCD, it offers digital signatures with full legal standing across the EU. Smart-ID is free to use and doesn't incur data roaming charges, though it's not yet as universally supported as the ID card or Mobile-ID, despite its growing popularity in the Baltic states.

## How Has Smart-ID Impacted Digital Transformation?

The adoption of Smart-ID has significantly advanced digital transformation and e-governance initiatives in Estonia and its neighboring countries by enhancing the accessibility, security, and efficiency of digital services.

In Estonia, Smart-ID has fortified the digital identity system alongside Mobile-ID and e-Residency, enabling secure online authentication and access to government services. This has streamlined processes such as tax declarations, voting, and healthcare management, with over 51% of Estonians regularly using digital services. Estonia's digital infrastructure, facilitated by platforms like X-Road, supports cross-border e-governance with Nordic countries, promoting a unified digital market.

Estonia's collaboration with the Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) has extended Smart-ID's benefits to neighboring countries, enabling cross-border digital services and fostering regional integration. Estonia's success with Smart-ID has influenced neighboring digital policies, encouraging the adoption of similar solutions and enhancing cybersecurity measures.

## Conclusion

Smart-ID exemplifies how technology can revolutionize digital identity and enhance trust in online transactions. By providing a secure, accessible, and legally compliant solution for authentication and electronic signatures, Smart-ID has become a cornerstone of Estonia's renowned digital ecosystem. Its app-based approach eliminates the need for specialized hardware, making secure digital interactions effortless and inclusive for users across various platforms and regions.

As Estonia continues to lead in digital transformation, Smart-ID's success highlights the importance of innovation in fostering efficient e-governance and seamless cross-border digital services. With its robust security features and compliance with the EU's eIDAS regulation, Smart-ID not only sets a high standard for digital identity solutions but also inspires neighboring countries to adopt forward-thinking technologies. This underscores its pivotal role in advancing secure, interconnected, and user-friendly digital landscapes across Europe and beyond.
