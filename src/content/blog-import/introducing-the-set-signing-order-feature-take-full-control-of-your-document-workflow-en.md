#### What Problem Does This Solve?

In many document workflows, certain signatures need to be collected before others. For instance, a manager may need to approve a contract before it goes to a legal department. Without a defined signing order, this process can become chaotic, with signatories signing in the wrong order or documents getting held up. This not only slows down the process but also increases the risk of errors and missed deadlines.

#### How the Set Signing Order Feature Works

With Agrello’s new **Set Signing Order** feature, you can now define the exact sequence in which each signatory will receive and sign the document. Here’s how it works:

1.  **Create your document:** As usual, upload the document that needs to be signed.
2.  **Assign signatories:** Add the emails of the people who need to sign.
3.  **Set the signing order:** Click on the button "Set signing order" and simply arrange the signatories in the order they should sign. Agrello will make sure that each person receives the document at the right time.
4.  **Relax and let Agrello handle the rest:** Our platform will send out notifications to each signatory in sequence, ensuring the document is signed in the correct order, without any manual intervention.

This feature eliminates the guesswork and manual coordination, making sure your documents are signed promptly and in the right order—every time.

Try the new **Set Signing Order** feature today and take the complexity out of your e-signing workflows!
