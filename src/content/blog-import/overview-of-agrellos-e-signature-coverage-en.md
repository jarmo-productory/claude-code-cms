Agrello’s goal is to offer a clear and reliable signing experience, whether the user needs a simple electronic signature or a qualified electronic signature issued by a national identity solution. The following sections outline the supported signature levels, trusted providers, and country-specific capabilities.

## Overview of Signature Levels

Agrello supports multiple e-signature levels that differ in their security, identity verification strength, and legal effect. Below is a short, user-oriented overview of each level. Detailed references or regulatory links can be added later.

**Simple Electronic Signature (SES)  
**A SES is the most basic form of electronic signature. It confirms the signer’s intent but does not require strong identity verification. Agrello’s own e-signature belongs to this category and is available globally. SES is suitable for low-risk agreements where a simple proof of intent is sufficient.

**Advanced Electronic Signature (AES)  
**An AES provides a stronger link between the signer and the signature. The signer’s identity is validated using a method that ensures integrity and prevents tampering. [Swedish Bank-ID](https://www.bankid.com/en/privat/skaffa-bankid) and the [Ukrainian Diia](https://expo.diia.gov.ua/) app generate AES-level signatures. AES can be used in scenarios where greater assurance is required but a fully qualified signature is not legally mandatory.

**Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)  
**A QES is the highest e-signature level and is legally equivalent to a handwritten signature in the European Union. It requires identification through a certified trust service and the use of a qualified certificate. [Mobile-ID](https://www.mobiil-id.ee/), [Smart-ID](https://www.smart-id.com/et/), and [eParaksts](https://www.eparaksts.lv/) all issue QES-level signatures in their respective countries. QES is required for high-trust documents and regulated processes.

These signature levels ensure that Agrello users can choose a signing method appropriate to their jurisdiction and the legal requirements of their documents.

## Output Formats and Document Types

Agrello supports multiple output formats to ensure that signed documents meet regulatory requirements and remain compatible with verification tools used in different regions. The available formats are consistent across all supported countries, although their legal effect depends on the signature level and provider used.

**PDF  
**A widely accepted format suitable for SES, AES, and QES signatures. Agrello embeds signature data so that the document can be validated using standard PDF signature verification tools. PDF is recommended for most user-facing agreements and general business documents.

**ASiC (Associated Signature Container)  
**A container-based format used primarily in the European Union. ASiC packages the original document together with signature data, ensuring strong integrity and long-term verifiability. This format requires QES-level signatures issued through Smart-ID, Mobile-ID, or eParaksts.

**eDOC  
**A structured electronic document format used in Latvia. eDOC is very similar technically to ASiC format. eDOC also packages the original document together with signature data, ensuring integrity and long-term verifiability. eDOC also requires QES-level signatures issued through Smart-ID, Mobile-ID, or eParaksts.

All formats produced by Agrello maintain compliance with the specifications required for their respective signature levels. Users can select the format that best meets their legal or operational needs.

**aDoc** \_(coming soon)  
\_The Lithuanian electronic signature container format that follows the national e-signature standard. aDoc (similar to ASiC and eDOC) ensures compatibility with QES providers mentioned above and will soon be supported by Agrello.

_Agrello e-signature methods_

**Agrello e-Sign (SES)  
**Available globally as a Simple Electronic Signature. It is suitable for general-purpose signing where formal identity verification is not legally required.

**ID-Card (QES)  
**Supported in Estonia. ID-card offers Qualified Electronic Signatures and is widely accepted for high-assurance transactions, including government and financial services.

**Mobile-ID (QES)  
**Supported in Estonia and Lithuania. Mobile-ID offers Qualified Electronic Signatures and is widely accepted for high-assurance transactions, including government and financial services.

**Smart-ID (QES)  
**Supported in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Belgium. Smart-ID is a certified solution that provides Qualified Electronic Signatures. It is often used for cross-border digital interactions within the EU.

**Swedish Bank-ID (AES)  
**Supported in Sweden. Bank-ID provides Advanced Electronic Signatures and is the primary digital identity method used in the Swedish market.

**eParaksts (QES)  
**Supported in Latvia. eParaksts issues Qualified Electronic Signatures and is a trusted solution for legally binding transactions in Latvia.

**Diia (AES)
