## How does signing work with Agrello's web application on mobile?

Agrello has made document signing on mobile phones remarkably simple and fast. When you receive a document for signing, you simply need to open the link received in your email in your phone's web browser. Whether it's Safari, Chrome, or any other popular browser, Agrello's web application is designed to work seamlessly with them.

After opening the link, you can immediately read through the document and sign it right there. The entire procedure is intuitive and often takes just a few minutes.

The Agrello platform supports multiple secure signing methods. In addition to qualified electronic signatures provided through Mobile-ID and Smart-ID, which are popular in Estonia and are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures, you can also use ID cards (via computer), Agrello's own e-signature, and international solutions such as Swedish BankID and Latvian eParaksts Mobile. Agrello's e-signature is particularly convenient and suitable for many business contracts and is easy to use even for partners who lack local digital identity solutions.

The main advantage is ease of use – there's no need to search for, download, and set up a separate mobile application. Everything works directly in your phone's web browser, saving both time and device memory. This means you can sign documents anywhere and anytime, provided you have a smartphone with an internet connection.

The process is fast and efficient. From receiving the document link to having a signed document often takes less than five minutes. This is particularly valuable in situations where time is of critical importance.

Additionally, since Agrello's web application is fully optimized for mobile devices, the user experience is smooth and trouble-free, regardless of whether you're using a phone with iOS or Android operating system.

Therefore, if you value speed, convenience, and flexibility, Agrello's web application is an excellent solution for mobile document signing. It allows you to focus on what's important, leaving the technical details to Agrello.
