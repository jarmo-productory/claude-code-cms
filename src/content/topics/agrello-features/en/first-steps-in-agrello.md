You've just logged in to Agrello. Let's get you oriented so you can start working with documents right away.

## Your Home Screen

When you log in first time, this is what you see:

![Agrello home screen for new users](../../../assets/agrello-home-new-user.webp)

The interface has two main areas:

**Left sidebar** is your navigation:

- **Your workspace** (named after your company) contains all your folders. Create as many as you need - by client, project, or document type.
- **Inbox** is where documents from others appear. It has three sections: _Invitations_, _Waiting for my signature_, and _All documents_.
- **My account** is where you manage your profile and settings.

**Main area** shows what's inside your currently selected folder. Right now it's empty and ready for your first document.

## Upload Your First Document

The screen is already inviting you to get started. Click the **Upload Document** button, or drag a file directly into the main area. Agrello accepts PDF, Word, and Excel files.

Once uploaded, Agrello opens your document right away:

You see the document preview and the status bar at the top: Draft → Preparing for signing → In signing → Signed. Click **Continue** when you're ready to move forward.

That's your first step done.

## Next: Send Your Document for Signing

Now that you have a document uploaded, you're ready to send it for signatures. The full walkthrough is in our next guide:

[Creating and Sending Documents for Signature](https://www.agrello.io/posts/creating-a-document-for-signing)

You'll learn how to add signers, place signature fields, and send the document - all in about two minutes.
