An Agrello document is more than a file. It's a container—a secure package that holds everything related to your agreement in one place.

## What is a Document Container?

When you create a document in Agrello, you're not just uploading a file. You're creating a container that will hold:

- **Your files** — one or multiple documents that form the agreement
- **Signatures** — digital signatures with certificates and timestamps
- **Fillable fields** — data that signers provide before signing
- **Comments** — collaboration threads between team members and reviewers
- **Reminders** — deadline tracking and follow-up notifications
- **Viewer access** — controlled access for people who need to see but not sign
- **Audit trail** — a complete, tamper-proof record of every action

This container structure is what makes digital agreements legally valid and trustworthy. Every interaction is recorded. Every signature is cryptographically sealed. Nothing can be altered after signing without detection.

Think of it as the difference between emailing a PDF back and forth versus having a proper system. With email, you lose track of versions, you can't prove who signed what and when, and there's no central record. With Agrello's container approach, everything stays together—organized, tracked, and legally defensible.

## Document Lifecycle

Every document moves through four states:

**Draft** — Your starting point. Upload files, edit content, organize in folders. Nothing is locked yet. You're preparing the agreement.

**Preparing for Signing** — Content is now locked. You add signers, set signature requirements, customize invitations. The document is ready but hasn't been sent yet.

**In Signing** — Invitations are out. Signers receive the document, review it, and add their signatures. You can track progress, send reminders, and see exactly where things stand.

**Signed** — All signatures collected. The document becomes immutable—permanently sealed. Everyone receives their copy. The audit trail locks. This is your legally binding agreement.

The progression is intentional. Each state has a clear purpose, and moving between states requires deliberate action. This prevents accidents—you can't accidentally send an unfinished document for signing, and signed documents can't be quietly modified.

That's the core of how Agrello works: your agreement lives in a secure container that keeps everything together, tracks every action, and produces legally valid proof of what was agreed and by whom.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is a document container in Agrello?**

A container is a secure wrapper that holds your files, signatures, comments, reminders, and a complete audit trail in one legally binding package. It's not just a file—it's everything related to that agreement in one place.

**How does the document lifecycle work?**

Documents progress through four states: Draft (editing), Preparing for Signing (setup), In Signing (collecting signatures), and Signed (complete and immutable). Each transition is deliberate and tracked.

**Is the audit trail legally valid?**

Yes. The audit trail records every action with timestamps, IP addresses, and authentication details. This creates tamper-proof evidence that holds up in legal proceedings and regulatory audits.
