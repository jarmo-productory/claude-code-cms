  - answer: Workspace roles (Owner/Administrator/Member) control workspace-wide capabilities
      like billing and member management. Folder permissions (Editor/Viewer) control
      access to specific folders and documents.
    question: What's the difference between workspace roles and folder permissions?
  - answer: No, Members only see folders they've been explicitly invited to. Administrators
      and Owners can view all folders automatically for oversight and management.
    question: Can a Member see all folders in the workspace?
  - answer: Editors can create documents, create templates, send for signing, and export
      CSV data. Viewers can only view documents and add comments for feedback.
    question: What can Editors do that Viewers cannot?

Agrello uses two permission layers. **Workspace roles** control who can manage billing, invite members, and see all folders. **Folder permissions** control who can create documents or just view them. Together, they let you give each person exactly the access they need.

## Workspace Roles

**Owner** has full control including billing and workspace settings. Typically the business owner or finance contact. One per workspace is recommended.

**Administrator** manages team workflows—can invite members, grant folder access, and see all folders. Cannot access billing. Ideal for department heads and team leads.

**Member** works only in folders they're invited to. Cannot see other folders or invite others. This is the default role for most team members.

## Folder Permissions

Once someone has a workspace role, you grant them access to specific folders:

**Editor** can create documents, send for signing, manage templates, and export data. Give this to people who actively work with contracts.

**Viewer** can view documents and add comments, but cannot create or send anything. Perfect for executives monitoring progress, legal reviewing drafts, or external stakeholders.

## Who Gets What?

**Most employees** should be Members with Editor access to their department folder. HR staff get Editor on the HR folder. Sales reps get Editor on Sales. They work independently without seeing other departments.

**Department heads** work well as Administrators. They see all folders, which helps coordinate cross-team work. They can grant access to their team members without bothering the Owner.

**Executives and auditors** often need Member role with Viewer access to multiple folders. They monitor activity and review documents without accidentally creating or modifying anything.

**External collaborators**—contractors, clients, legal reviewers—should be Members with access to one specific project folder. Give them Editor if they need to create documents, Viewer if they just need to review. Remove access when the engagement ends.

## Quick Tips

**Start with minimum access.** Give Viewer first, upgrade to Editor when needed. Give Member role first, upgrade to Administrator only for true coordinators.

**Organize folders by function.** When folders match departments, permissions become intuitive. HR folder for HR team. Finance folder for finance team.

**Use Viewer for approvals.** Legal reviews a draft as Viewer, adds approval comments, then the Editor sends it. Clean separation of review and action.

**Review quarterly.** Check who has access to what. Remove former employees. Adjust permissions when people change roles.
