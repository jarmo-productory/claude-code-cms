Getting started with Agrello is quick and straightforward. Whether you're setting up your first digital signature solution or migrating from another platform, this guide will walk you through every step of creating and configuring your Agrello account.

## Account Creation Options

You have **three convenient ways** to create your Agrello account, designed to fit your preferred authentication method:

**Google Account Integration**: Connect seamlessly with your existing Google credentials for instant access.

**Microsoft Account Integration**: Use your Microsoft business or personal account for streamlined login.

**Email-Based Authentication**: Receive a secure one-time login code directly to your email - no password required.

To get started, visit our website and click the prominent blue **"Get Started"** button, or navigate directly to [docs.agrello.io](https://docs.agrello.io) to open our application interface.

## The One-Time Login Process

Our email-based authentication system offers enhanced security without the hassle of remembering passwords. Here's how it works:

When you select the email option, simply **enter your email address** and check your inbox for a message with the subject line "Agrello: Validate your email." Copy the verification code from the email into the input field within our web application.

During your first login, you'll be prompted to provide basic contact details including your name and company information. This data helps us create your personalized workspace and ensures proper account management.

## Workspace Creation and Management

Upon successful account creation, **Agrello automatically generates your first workspace** based on the company name you provided during registration. As the account creator, you're designated as the workspace owner, giving you full administrative privileges.

Your workspace serves as the central hub for all document-related activities, team collaboration, and subscription management. You can create multiple workspaces later if needed, making it easy to separate different business units or client projects.

## Understanding Your 14-Day Free Trial

Every new Agrello account includes a **comprehensive 14-day trial period** that requires no credit card information. During this trial, you have access to:

**Full Platform Functionality**: Create, edit, and sign documents using all available features.

**Unlimited Document Creation**: No restrictions on the number of documents you can process.

**Complete Feature Access**: Explore contract templates, workflow automation, and advanced signature options.

**Team Collaboration Tools**: Invite colleagues and test multi-user workflows.

This trial period is designed to give you a complete understanding of how Agrello can transform your document management processes.

## Managing Your Subscription Transition

When you're ready to continue beyond the trial period, upgrading to a paid subscription is straightforward:

**Access Subscription Settings**: Click on the trial banner next to your name in the top toolbar, or navigate through your workspace name in the left navigation pane and select "Subscription."

**Choose Your Plan**: Review available subscription options and select the plan that best fits your business needs.

**Secure Payment Processing**: Enter your credit card details to activate your subscription. All payment information is processed through secure, encrypted channels.

The transition from trial to paid subscription is seamless - all your existing documents, templates, and workspace configurations remain intact.

## What Happens After Trial Expiration

If you haven't added payment information before your trial expires, **your account transitions to a limited access state**. While your documents and data remain secure and accessible, you won't be able to create new documents or process new signatures until you activate a subscription.

This approach ensures you never lose important work while giving you flexibility in deciding when to upgrade.

## Next Steps: Maximizing Your Agrello Experience

With your account successfully created, you're ready to explore Agrello's powerful features. Consider starting with:

**Document Template Creation**: Build reusable templates for your most common document types.

**Team Member Invitations**: Add colleagues to streamline collaborative workflows.

**Integration Setup**: Connect Agrello with your existing business tools and platforms.

**Workflow Customization**: Configure approval processes and signing sequences that match your business requirements.

Your Agrello account is now ready to help you modernize your document management processes and improve business efficiency through digital transformation.
