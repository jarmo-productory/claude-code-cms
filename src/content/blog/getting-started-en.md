# Welcome to Claude Code CMS

This is a sample blog post demonstrating how the markdown-based content system works.

## Markdown Support

You can use all standard markdown formatting:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Numbered and bullet lists
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Headers (H1-H6)
- Code blocks

### Code Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
```

## Images

Images can be referenced with relative paths (`./images/`) or absolute paths (`/images/blog/`).

## Next Steps

1. Replace this post with your own content
2. Add your images to `public/images/blog/`
3. Update the frontmatter with your own data
