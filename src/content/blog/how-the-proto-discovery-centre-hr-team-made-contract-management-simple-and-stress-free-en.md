### **The PROTO Discovery Centre and Their Journey Toward Simpler Workflows**

The [PROTO Discovery Centre](https://www.prototehas.ee) is a place where science and creativity meet – an inspiring environment inviting both children and adults to explore, experiment, and learn. Behind the scenes is a dedicated team ensuring everything runs seamlessly – from visitor experiences to employee and partner contracts.

The HR department plays a key role in this ecosystem. Their responsibilities include preparing and managing dozens of contracts – from new employee agreements and collaboration contracts to seasonal staff documents and more.

Although PROTO is known for its forward-thinking approach and appreciation for technology, managing contracts used to be a manual and time-consuming process. Each document had to be created individually and tracked in Excel sheets to monitor who had signed and who still needed a reminder.

Like many other organizations, PROTO’s HR team found that managing documents manually was becoming both time-consuming and stressful. This prompted them to start looking for a better way – a solution that would bring simplicity, transparency, and peace of mind to their daily work.

### **Everyday Challenges of Managing HR Contracts**

The “paperwork” behind HR operations often goes unseen – yet it’s what quietly keeps the organization running smoothly. Somewhere in the background, employment agreements, collaboration contracts, and other essential documents are created and signed, ensuring that everyone can focus on their core work. But behind this process lies a mountain of repetitive, detail-oriented, and high-responsibility tasks.

A typical HR manager or specialist is responsible for:

- drafting and adjusting contracts,
- double-checking that every detail is correct – from ID numbers and job titles to bank accounts,
- sending documents to the right people,
- keeping track of who has signed and who still needs a reminder, and
- archiving all signed documents.

When these steps are handled manually – using Word templates, email chains, and Excel spreadsheets – the workday quickly becomes fragmented and stressful. Even the smallest mistake can lead to delays, corrections, and confusion.

It’s a familiar story for many HR professionals who, like the team at PROTO Discovery Centre, feel trapped in a constant cycle of checking, reminding, and following up.

This way of working doesn’t just consume time – it drains energy. As a result, HR professionals often find that their strategic priorities, like employee development, building a strong workplace culture, and supporting the team, end up taking a back seat to repetitive administrative tasks that eat up most of the day.

### **First Steps with Agrello**

When the HR team at the PROTO Discovery Centre began looking for a way to simplify their contract management, their goal was clear: **they needed a solution that was** **simple, secure, and quick to implement** **— one that didn’t require IT involvement or complex systems.**

That’s when they discovered **Agrello**.

Agrello offered everything the PROTO HR team was looking for — a clear and logical workflow where the entire contract lifecycle happens in one environment, from creation to signature. Everything they needed was there, without unnecessary extras that could complicate the process.

Their first experience with Agrello was **smooth and straightforward**. Even a short onboarding session was enough to give the HR team confidence that they could use the platform independently. The interface felt intuitive and familiar — designed for people who want to focus on content, not on technicalities.

One of the aspects that stood out most for PROTO’s HR Manager, **Ina Tepp**, was **Agrello’s customer support**.  
Whether through email or a good old-fashioned phone call, help was always available — promptly, kindly, and professionally. Every question found an answer, and most importantly, the team felt valued and genuinely supported.

> “I’d especially like to highlight the customer support — whether you prefer email or a traditional phone call, you always get help quickly and in a friendly way. Every question is answered clearly, and advice is shared with genuine care,”  
> said Ina Tepp, HR Manager at the PROTO Discovery Centre.

For PROTO, Agrello quickly proved to be more than just a tool — it became **a true partner**, committed to supporting its clients every step of the way. This approach resonated perfectly with PROTO’s own values of **clarity, collaboration, and human connection**.

### **Results: A Simpler, Clearer, and Calmer Workday**

The impact was immediate.  
Where previously a large part of each workday was spent drafting contracts, tracking progress, and sending reminders, **Agrello turned the entire process into a smooth, transparent flow**.

All contracts now live in one place — with a clear overview of:

- who has received the document,
- who has already signed, and
- who still needs a reminder.

No more scrolling through endless Excel sheets or digging through email threads to find out the status of a contract. All the information is visible at a glance.

Creating documents has also become significantly faster. Thanks to **templates and data imports from Excel**, the HR team can now generate multiple contracts at once, minimizing the risk of manual errors.  
That means no more mix-ups with ID numbers, names, or bank details — just clean, accurate documents every time.

> “Creating and managing contracts is now so much easier — everything is logical and user-friendly. There’s no need to worry whether the data is correct or who has already received their contract. Everything happens smoothly and transparently,”  
> shared **Ina Tepp**, HR Manager at the PROTO Discovery Centre.

The change has made work not only faster but also calmer.  
The HR department no longer worries about missing signatures or forgotten documents. Agrello gives them peace of mind that every step happens automatically and on time.

And beyond the efficiency gains, the new workflow saves **valuable time** — time that can now be dedicated to what truly matters in HR: supporting new employees, developing the team, and nurturing a strong workplace culture.

> “Introducing Agrello was the best decision we made this year for improving our HR processes,”  
> Ina sums up. “It’s a service that genuinely makes daily work easier.”

And perhaps the most fitting summary came from Ina herself after our conversation:

**“It’s a huge win — for both our time and our peace of mind.”**

### **Lessons and Recommendations for Other HR Teams**

PROTO’s experience clearly shows that effective HR work doesn’t depend only on skills and dedication — it also depends on having the **right tools**. When document management becomes too time-consuming and manual, it takes the focus away from what truly matters: **people**.

Here are the three key lessons PROTO’s HR team learned — insights that any HR professional could benefit from:

#### **1\. Simplicity Is the Greatest Advantage**

A digital solution doesn’t have to be complex to be effective.  
In fact, the simpler and more intuitive the tool, the faster it’s embraced and becomes part of everyday work.  
For the PROTO team, Agrello’s biggest strength was exactly that — a logical, familiar interface that worked right away, without the need for IT support. Everything just made sense from the start.

#### **2\. Clarity Reduces Stress**

When you can see the status of every contract at a glance, there’s no more need for constant checking, calls, or follow-ups. This kind of visibility creates confidence and drastically reduces the daily tension that comes with manual monitoring and document control. The result? A calmer, more focused HR team that can dedicate their attention to what matters most — employee well-being and growth.

#### **3\. Support and Partnership Matter as Much as Technology**

PROTO’s HR Manager emphasized again and again that Agrello’s customer support is one of the platform’s strongest assets. Quick, friendly, and knowledgeable assistance gives teams the reassurance that they’re never left alone. This kind of human connection is often underestimated — but it’s exactly what transforms a digital tool into a **trusted partner**.

PROTO’s story is a powerful reminder that even small changes in work processes can make a big difference.

Automation and digital tools don’t have to mean big, expensive systems.

Sometimes, **one simple, well-designed solution** that fits naturally into your existing workflow is enough to save hours of repetitive work — and bring calm, clarity, and focus back to your team.

### **Simplicity That Creates Real Value**

The experience of the PROTO Discovery Centre proves that the biggest changes don’t always come from implementing complex systems — they come from finding **simple, well-designed solutions**. With Agrello, PROTO’s HR team gained not only speed and structure but also peace of mind — the confidence that everything moves in the right direction, at the right time.

This transformation allowed them to focus their energy where it truly matters — **on people, the team, and their growth**.

At Agrello, our mission is to empower organizations to take exactly these kinds of steps forward. We believe that **technology should serve people, not the other way around**. That’s why we design tools that are logical, easy to adopt, and dependable — just as they proved to be for the PROTO HR team.

When workflows become simpler, there’s space to breathe, think, and grow. And that’s the real value Agrello brings — not just as an e-signing platform, but as a **partner** helping organizations work **calmer, clearer, and smarter**.
