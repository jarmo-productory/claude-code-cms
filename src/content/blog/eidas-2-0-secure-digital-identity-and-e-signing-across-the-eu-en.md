At its core, eIDAS 2.0 is more than just a legal upgrade. It’s the foundation for a **European Digital Identity Wallet**—a secure mobile app that lets citizens, residents, and businesses prove who they are and sign documents electronically anywhere in the EU. Seamlessly. Legally. Instantly.

This new framework aims to close the gap between fragmented national systems and a fully functional digital single market. And that means less friction, fewer delays, and far more confidence in digital interactions—whether you're applying for a loan, signing a contract, or onboarding new employees remotely.

## **From Clunky to Seamless: A Quick Look at What’s Changing**

When eIDAS 1.0 came into force, it was a milestone. It established the legal groundwork for electronic signatures, ensuring that a **Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)** would hold the same weight as a handwritten one anywhere in the EU. In theory, it enabled secure cross-border transactions. In practice, it often fell short.

Why? Because most of the tools available were too fragmented, too technical, or simply too inconvenient. Many countries built their own national eID systems, but interoperability was inconsistent. For end users, signing a document electronically might require a smart card reader, a USB token, a third-party signature app, or a patchwork of passwords and certificates.

**eIDAS 2.0 changes the game.** Instead of separate solutions for each country—or each provider—it brings everything under one cohesive, user-friendly system: the **European Digital Identity Wallet**. This mobile wallet will let users identify themselves, authenticate online, and apply legally binding signatures in just a few taps.

What used to involve multiple devices and apps can now be done through one government-issued mobile wallet. You no longer need to buy a certificate, configure a plugin, or guess whether your e-signature will be accepted in another EU country. With eIDAS 2.0, **the answer is always yes**.

It’s a fundamental shift. Not only are the legal standards being expanded and clarified, but the user experience is being reimagined. **Security remains strict, but access becomes simple.** The result is a digital identity and signing solution that feels more like a utility—and less like an IT project.

## **What Is the EU Digital Identity Wallet and Why It Matters?**

At the heart of eIDAS 2.0 lies a new cornerstone: the **European Digital Identity Wallet**. This isn’t just another app. It’s a secure, state-issued tool designed to give every EU citizen and resident control over their identity and digital interactions across borders.

Think of it as a digital briefcase that lives on your phone. Inside, you’ll find your verified identity, driving licence, diplomas, and soon, the ability to **sign documents with legal certainty**—no printing, scanning, or third-party services required. For the first time, identity, verification, and signing come together in one unified experience.

The wallet doesn’t just replace old tools—it improves them. Instead of showing your full ID to prove you’re over 18, you’ll share only that fact—nothing more. Instead of logging into ten different portals with ten different passwords, your wallet can authenticate you instantly, securely, and with your consent.

Each EU Member State will offer at least one approved wallet, built on the same technical standards. Whether issued in France, Estonia, or Germany, **all wallets will be interoperable and accepted across the Union**. This creates a true digital single market where trust travels as freely as people do.

With the wallet, digital identity becomes mobile, modern, and modular. It's not just a tool for citizens—it’s a foundation for how services will be delivered, contracts signed, and identities verified in a digitally sovereign Europe.

## **How Will Wallet-Based Signing Work?**

One of the most practical features of the EU Digital Identity Wallet is its ability to support **qualified electronic signatures**. These signatures carry the same legal weight as signing a document by hand and are accepted in every EU Member State. But how does this process work in real life?

It starts when a user is prompted to sign a document—say, a rental agreement or a consent form. Instead of downloading third-party apps or using hardware tokens, the user simply selects the option to **sign using their Digital Identity Wallet**. On a computer, this might display a QR code; on a smartphone, it may redirect directly to the wallet app.

Once inside the wallet, the user is asked to authenticate—typically using biometrics or a secure PIN. This step verifies the person’s identity and confirms their intention to sign. The app displays the key information about the document being signed, ensuring full transparency before consent is given.

Behind the scenes, the wallet uses **cryptographic keys and a qualified certificate** to create the signature. Depending on the country’s implementation, this signature may be generated directly on the user’s device or via a secure, certified service in the cloud. Either way, the result is the same: a legally valid, tamper-evident signature tied to a verified EU identity.

For the user, the entire process takes less than a minute. It’s as intuitive as confirming a bank transfer, but far more powerful in terms of legal impact and cross-border recognition. The days of printing, scanning, or posting signed documents are nearing an end.

## **Do You Need Another App for That? Probably Not**

One of the key strengths of the EU Digital Identity Wallet is its simplicity. Unlike earlier digital signature tools that often required additional hardware, separate applications, or complex setup, **the wallet is designed to function as an all-in-one solution**.

For everyday users, this means no external plugins, no third-party signature services, and no recurring license fees. The wallet itself will include everything needed to create and manage **qualified electronic signatures**—from secure authentication to certificate management.

More importantly, users won’t need to manually install or configure anything beyond the wallet app. When a document needs to be signed, the system will trigger the wallet automatically—whether it’s through a government portal, financial institution, or employer platform. The signing process is **integrated and seamless**, not an add-on.

In technical terms, the wallet serves as a **Qualified Signature Creation Device**. This means it meets strict EU cybersecurity standards and is recognized by all Member States. Once activated, it enables signatures that are fully compliant with eIDAS 2.0—without relying on additional tools or services.

For most individuals and small businesses, the wallet will replace the need for separate e-signature providers entirely. Only in highly specialized use cases—such as enterprise-scale automation—might additional solutions still be relevant. But for signing a contract, authorizing a payment, or approving a legal document, **the wallet will be the only tool you need**.

## **Where and When Can You Get Your Wallet?**

The rollout of the EU Digital Identity Wallet will be coordinated by each Member State, but guided by a single European standard. According to the current regulation, **every EU country must offer at least one certified wallet by 2026**. Several pilot projects are already underway, with national apps expected to be launched progressively from 2025 onward.

When available, the wallet will be provided as a **mobile application**—free to download, officially issued, and certified by your home country. Just like you might install a government app for tax returns or health certificates, the Digital Identity Wallet will be available through standard app stores, such as Google Play and Apple’s App Store.

To activate the wallet, users will go through a **one-time identity verification process**. This may involve scanning a biometric passport or national ID card, using an existing electronic ID, or confirming identity via secure online methods such as bank login. Once completed, the wallet becomes your verified digital identity tool—ready to use for both identification and signing.

Importantly, the wallet you receive from your country will be **fully interoperable across the EU**. A person living in Italy with an Italian-issued wallet can use it just as easily in France, Germany, or any other Member State. There's no need to register for multiple systems or manage separate digital identities depending on where you do business or travel.

For EU residents who are not citizens, wallets will also be made available through national identity systems. This ensures broad coverage for people living, working, or studying across borders.

In short, **the wallet will be issued by your national authority, work across the entire EU, and require nothing more than your phone and a few minutes to set up**. When it arrives, it won’t be another layer of complexity—it will be a streamlined gateway to secure digital participation.

These are no longer future scenarios—they’re becoming standard, enabled by **wallet-based signing and verified identity at your fingertips**.

Users will no longer need to manage multiple digital IDs, remember endless passwords, or rely on local notaries.
