## What is Ukrainian Diia E-Signature?

Diia.Signature is Ukraine's government-backed electronic signature system that allows Ukrainian citizens and residents to sign documents directly from their smartphones using the [official Diia mobile app](https://diia.gov.ua/). Developed as part of Ukraine's comprehensive digital government initiative, Diia.Signature can be activated in just one minute and immediately used to sign various documents with full legal recognition.

The system works through photo verification and a secure five-digit code process within the Diia app, ensuring robust identity authentication while maintaining user convenience. What makes Diia.Signature particularly valuable is its cross-border legal recognition – while it holds full legal status equivalent to handwritten signatures in Ukraine, it's also recognized in the European Union as an [Advanced Electronic Signature (AdES)](https://www.agrello.io/post/what-should-you-know-about-eidas-when-e-signing-eu-business-contracts), providing reliable legal enforceability for business and personal transactions.

Ukrainian citizens or residents can activate Diia.Signature regardless of their current location, making it an ideal solution for the Ukrainian diaspora across Europe who need to maintain legal document workflows in both their host countries and Ukraine.

## How does Agrello's Diia integration work?

Agrello's Diia e-signature integration seamlessly connects your document workflows with Ukraine's trusted digital signature system. When you create or share documents through Agrello, Ukrainian signers can now choose Diia.Signature as their preferred signing method, providing them with a familiar and legally recognized option that works directly through their smartphone.

The signing process is remarkably straightforward: recipients receive your document through Agrello's standard sharing methods, select Diia.Signature as their signing option, and are directed to complete the signing process through their Diia mobile app. The app handles identity verification through photo recognition and secure code entry, then applies the qualified electronic signature to the document.

Once signed, the document is automatically returned to Agrello with full audit trails and legal compliance documentation. The entire process maintains Agrello's high security standards while leveraging Diia's robust identity verification and signature creation capabilities, ensuring that documents signed through this method meet both Ukrainian and EU legal requirements.

## What makes Diia e-signature valuable for international business?

The primary advantage of Agrello's Diia integration is removing barriers for Ukrainian citizens and residents who need to participate in EU-based document workflows. Rather than requiring complex workarounds or additional verification steps, Ukrainian signers can use their trusted government-issued digital identity to sign contracts, agreements, and forms with immediate legal validity.

For businesses operating across Ukraine and EU markets, this integration provides operational continuity and legal certainty. Employment contracts, service agreements, NDAs, and other business documents can be signed by Ukrainian team members or partners using a method they already trust and understand, while maintaining full legal enforceability in both jurisdictions.

The integration also addresses compliance requirements for organizations that work with Ukrainian citizens but operate under EU regulations. Since Diia.Signature meets [AdES standards in the EU](https://www.agrello.io/post/what-should-you-know-about-eidas-when-e-signing-eu-business-contracts) while maintaining [QES status in Ukraine](https://www.agrello.io/digital-signing/what-is-a-qualified-electronic-signature), businesses can maintain consistent document workflows without compromising legal validity or creating separate processes for different nationalities.

Additionally, the smartphone-based signing process aligns with modern mobile-first expectations, making it particularly valuable for remote work scenarios and international collaborations where traditional signature methods might be impractical.
